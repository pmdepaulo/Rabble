Homework #1:
  Task 1:
    I prompted ChatGPT 4o with the example prompt from the homework writeup: "In a Django template, how could I print one text if the user is logged in, and a different one if no user is logged in?"
    This helped me understand some of the syntax better and use the "is authenticated" Django syntax.

  Task 2:
    I prompted the same AI tool with "get user email address from django user model"
    I realized that it is the same format as user.username with help from an example that the AI tool provided.
  
  Task 3:
    As mentioned in the writeup, it was permitted to paste our base.html code into an AI model to help understand it, so I pasted that code along with the prompt:
    "how can i edit the large block of code above to add a my profile button if a user is logged in"
    This then gave me some code for making a profile button and I used that to make a second Log Out button. 
    Finally, I was curious about how to customize the buttons, so I sent in the prompt "what are the different btn classes" so that I could understand the "btn" types better.
    It gave me a bunch of color customizations and different styles that I chose from to make my Rabble buttons.
