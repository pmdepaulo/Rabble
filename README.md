Rabble is a community-based forum website where users can join Subrabbles, make posts, comment, like other user's posts, and interact with the general space!
Includes Django REST API, continuous integration with pytest, extensive frontend features in HTML and CSS, and more. 

Programmed by Paulina DePaulo for [CMSC 22000 - Introduction to Software Development](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/). I acknowledge Borja Sotomayor and all course staff for assistance.
